# Netbird-Helm

Hello bold explorer! You've found a little nook in experience where I've built a thing to run Netbird in a kubernetes cluster. However, I've only tested
it in my environment, and I don't know how good it will be yet, so take this in the manner it's intended. It's not fit for *any* purpose, and if you want
to try it, go for it, but don't blame me if it doesn't work.

Feel free to log issues if you want, but don't tell me that I've made a helm chart wrong, because I've just cobbled it together to prove it works :)

Thanks!
